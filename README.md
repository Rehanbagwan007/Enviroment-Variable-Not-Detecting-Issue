# 🛠️ Prisma Environment Variable Issue - DATABASE_URL Not Found

## ❌ Problem

When running the command:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

I got this error:

```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Error: Prisma schema validation - (get-config wasm)
Error code: P1012
error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
  -->  prisma/schema.prisma:14
```

Even though I had already set `DATABASE_URL` in my `.env` file like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/db?sslmode=require"
```

---

## ✅ Root Cause

- The `.env` file was present but had one of the following issues:
  - It used quotes (`"`) around the value
  - It had hidden formatting characters (like BOM, smart quotes, wrong line endings)
  - It didn’t end with a newline
  - It wasn’t being read properly by the terminal or Prisma

---

## 🧩 Solution (Fixed Method)

### 1. **Delete the corrupted `.env` file**:

```bash
rm .env
```

### 2. **Create a clean one from the terminal**:

```bash
nano .env
```

Paste this (without quotes, no trailing spaces):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://youruser:yourpassword@yourhost/db?sslmode=require
```

✅ **Make sure the file ends with a blank line (press Enter)**

Then save:
- `Ctrl + O` → Enter
- `Ctrl + X`

---

### 3. **Test the environment variable**:

```bash
grep DATABASE_URL .env
```

Should output your URL.

---

### 4. **Run Prisma commands again**:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

✅ Done — database synced successfully!

---

## 🧠 Tip

Always commit a `.env.example` like this:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
```

And **never commit the real `.env` file** to GitHub.
